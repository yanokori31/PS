# PS
PCS is a science-oriented compute system using a multi-stage parser with Python and JSON to process math, physics, and chemistry. It supports IntelliSense and short English-style commands like sqrt(2,4), calcF(m,a), mixH2O(). The parser interprets expressions, links modules, and delivers fast, precise results across domains.
